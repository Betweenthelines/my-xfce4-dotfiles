# my-xfce4-dotfiles
Arch only xfce4 dotfiles I have not implemented any backup system for another person.
XFCE4 is also a prerequisite


Run :

`chmod +x install.sh`

`./install.sh`

This mostly makes xfce4 default look like mine. I have not replaced compton with picom. I leave it to users. 

If you want to use picom instead 
1. disable compositor from windows-manager-tweaks
2. open session manager add entry picom just type `picom -b` all the prerequisites config are included in the dotfiles


My custom Windows Keybindings should also be transferred 

a <br />Super + Arrow kews (window tiling)
b  <br />Super + hjkl (window tiling)
Super + tab rofi
Super + 12345 (change workspaces)
Alt + tab (iconify window)
Super + Return (open terminal)
Super + w (firefox)
Super + f (thunar)
Ctrl + q (quit the window)
